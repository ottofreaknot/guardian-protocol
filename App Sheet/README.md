## 🗂 Step 1: Set Up Google Drive Structure

Create a main folder called:  
`Business App System`

Inside it, create subfolders:
- `/Forms` – optional
- `/Sheets` – databases
- `/Photos` – image uploads
- `/Client Files` – optional folders per client
- `/PDFs` – optional downloads

---

## 📊 Step 2: Create a Google Sheet

Create a Google Sheet named: `Work_Reports`

Add column headers like:

| Timestamp | Client | Date | Worker | Task | Location | Notes | Image |
|-----------|--------|------|--------|------|----------|-------|--------|

*Optional:* Create more sheets like `Maintenance Logs`, `Consultations`, or `Scheduling`.

---

## 📝 Step 3: (Optional) Create a Google Form

If you want to use Forms for data entry:

1. Go to [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com)
2. Create a form with fields that match your Sheet headers
3. Link it to your Sheet

Otherwise, AppSheet will handle form submissions.

## 📱 Step 4: Build Your App in AppSheet

1. Visit [https://www.appsheet.com](https://www.appsheet.com)
2. Click `Start for Free`
3. Choose your Google Sheet
4. AppSheet will auto-generate a basic app from your data

## 🎨 Step 5: Customize the App

### View Types

- **Deck View** – card-based layout
- **Table View** – spreadsheet-style
- **Form View** – for submitting entries
- **Detail View** – full record display

Edit views via:  
> **AppSheet Editor → UX → Views**

---

### Navigation

- Drag views to arrange their order
- Enable **Bottom Navigation Bar** in `UX → Options` if needed

---

### Data Column Setup

> Go to: **Data → Columns**

- Set `Image` column to type `Image`
- Set `Location` to `LatLong` (optional GPS)
- Use `Enum` for dropdown selections
- Enable “Show?” rules to hide/unhide fields dynamically

---

## 🔒 Step 6: Share the App

1. Go to **Users → Users**
2. Add your team’s email addresses
3. Choose whether the app is public or private
4. Team members can install the app on mobile or use it in the browser
