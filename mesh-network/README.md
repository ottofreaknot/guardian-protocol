# 🌐 Guardian Mesh Network

Decentralized, encrypted mesh communication layer for real-time alerts, location pings, and transparent coordination — without centralized servers.

Used by:
- Guardian Cube (stationary relay)

- Any approved mesh node or local mesh swarm drone

All traffic is:
- End-to-end encrypted
- Ephemeral unless abuse flagged
- Fully open-source and auditable
