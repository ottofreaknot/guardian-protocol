# 🛡️ Security Policy

Guardian Protocol is built to protect survivors, not exploit them. Security is not optional — it's core.

## 🔐 Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a vulnerability that:
- Compromises alert confidentiality
- Enables unauthorized surveillance
- Bypasses survivor controls
- Affects mesh routing, logging, or authentication

Please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, email:
**robinsonkeyjun@gmail.com**

We will respond within **7 days** and coordinate a responsible disclosure plan.

## ✅ Expectations

- All forks should notify users of security-critical updates.
- Any abuse-enabled forks may be publicly flagged, audited, or blacklisted.
- License violations will trigger termination protocols as outlined in `/anti-abuse/`.

## 📣 Transparency

Critical issues will be disclosed via the repository after responsible remediation.
We believe in public trust, not secrecy.
