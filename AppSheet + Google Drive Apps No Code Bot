## 🗂 Step 1: Set Up Your Google Drive Structure

Create a new folder called:  
`My Business App`

Inside it, add:

## 📊 Step 2: Create a Google Sheet

Create a Google Sheet named: `Work_Reports`

Add column headers like:

| Timestamp | Client | Date | Worker | Task | Location | Notes | Image |
|-----------|--------|------|--------|------|----------|-------|--------|

*Optional:* Add a second sheet for `Maintenance Logs`, `Consultations`, or `Scheduling`.

## 📝 Step 3: (Optional) Create a Google Form

You can skip this and let AppSheet handle form submissions.  
But if you want to:

- Go to [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com)
- Create a new form
- Link it to your Sheet (Responses tab → Link to Sheets)
- Match your columns from above

1. Go to: [https://www.appsheet.com](https://www.appsheet.com)
2. Click `Start for free`
3. Choose your Google Sheet from Step 2
4. AppSheet will auto-generate a working app from your data

### 🖼️ Change View Types

Use these views:
- **Deck View** – for card-style lists

## 🔒 Step 6: Share the App

1. Go to **Users > Users**
